/*
Input deck for organ on a chip modeling with simple concentration sensor
and a configurable PID controller.

Some notables:

(1) The sensor delays output by one cycle.   The timestep of the sensor operation can be changed by modifying SENSOR_RATE in the S_define file.   This will require a re-CP to take.
(2) The control rate can similarly be adjusted in S_define but should not be smaller than the SENSOR_RATE
(3) Change the desired Cm concentration "C_desired" in this input deck.    The Kp, Ki, and Kd gains can be set in Modified_data/concentration_control.d
(4) A bias term for the sensor measurement "sensor.concentration_sensor.bias" is included below and may be manipulated in this input deck or via monte carlo.
(5) The DP_organ_control provides a sample set of plots to track control performance and sensor error.
(6) Modify and run the Trick_profile_07.23.1 file included at the top level of this git repo to set your TRICK_CFLAGS appropriately.
